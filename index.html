"anti-cheat dialog message":"Today, the anti-cheat status is medium. You can use all the features of cheat. But don't use the old version of the cheat mod at all and only use the updates.

Note: No matter what the anti-cheat status low/medium/high(risk) is, the most important thing is to play without being reported by other players.
